\f0\fs24 \cf0 Two observable trends that can be tracked in these Panda data frames are that Charter schools perform higher than District schools in terms of test scores and that Students on average have more trouble with passing math classes than they do with passing reading classes. Charter schools have a 95% overall passing rate, while District schools have a 73% overall passing rate. You can also see this reflected in the fact that schools that spend less per student also have a higher rate of passing. Reading classes, no matter what the grade, are much easier to pass than Math classes according to this data. With no school having less than 80 percent of their students passing a Reading class, while multiple schools have less than 80 percent of their students passing a Math class.}
